NE_1_no_tie_break: just wanted to see what strategies where chosen without the tie break mechanism -- seems to be all uniform distributions over actions that result in the same utility.
NE_2_tie_break: (BOTH FIRST ROUND)
- each chose reference point after first round 
- after that the responder saw a better deal in the second round, so switched to that strategy
- proposer preferred the first round, so changed their second threshold to 1
- then they agreed in the first round and it is in NE, so they stay there
NE_3_tie_break: (Proposer 2nd round (REF) Responder 1st round(REF))
- each chose reference point after first round
- responder saw they could do better in second round after that, so set a higher threshold in round 1 and lower offer in round 2
- oppositely, proposer saw they could do better in first round and set a matching offer in the first round and raised their second round threshold
- proposer continued to match responder threshold in roudn 1  and keep their second round higher
- responder holds since now round 1 is better for them too
- proposer lowers second round acceptance threshold (to do better with the reference point?)
- responder notices and raises their acceptance threshold to take advantage of this
- propsoer moves second round threshold back up and meets the responder's first round threshold 
- now they agree in the first round and each can't do better in the second round, so NE!
NE_4_tie_break: (Proposer 2nd round (REF) Responder 1st round)
- proposer chooses reference point, responder chooses proposer's first deal (probably influenced by tie break mechanism)
- responder lowers threshold to get first round 
- proposer prefers second round, so keeps lowering offer to get the second round deal
- responder follows by lowering their threshold eventually changes their second round offer when first round deal becomes worse than making a second round deal
- responder holds their first round threshold and eventually proposer raises offer to meet this since they do slightly worse in the second round eventually
- now they agree in the first round and each can't do better in the second round so NE
NE_5_tie_break: (Proposer 2nd round Responder 1st round (REF))
- responder chooses reference point, proposer chooses responder's point but with a preference for the second round by making a slightly lower offer
- tie break mechanism causes responder to choose a high offer in the second round when switching their first round to match proposer
- this gives incentive for the proposer to lower their first round deal
- responder keeps following by lowering their threshold until responder would do worse in the first round
- proposer eventually matches responder's first round thershold since the second round eventually does slightly worse for them
- now they agree in the first round and can't do better in the second round and we have NE!
NE_6_tie_break: (BOTH FIRST ROUND)
- each chooose each other's first point and high second round due to tie break mechanism
- responder matches proposer since second round is obviously worse
- proposer chooses reference point since second round is much better and reference point supports this
- responder takes advantage of lowered second round threshold
- proposer moves thresold back up and matches responder since now they're doing worse in the second round
- now they agree in the first round and can't do better in the second so NE
NE_7_tie_break: (BOTH SECOND ROUND)
- each choose each other's first point with a preference for the second round for each
- responder moves to reference point, proposer lowers threshold to get second round deal (previously getting nothing)
- proposer matches low offer in first round to take advantage of responder
- responder changes first round threshold to be 1 and matches proposer's thresohld in round 2
- since responder holds at a thresold of 1 and proposer holds at offer of 0.04, the second round is a better deal
- they agree in the second round too, so NE is reached
not_quite_nash:
- same lowering and following behavior, eventually proposer will raise offer to match the first round threshold is my guess since eventually second round will be slightly worse

NE_8_tie_break: (Proposer 2nd round Responder 1st round)
NE_9_tie_break: (BOTH FIRST ROUND) -- but they end up in the second round deal...
